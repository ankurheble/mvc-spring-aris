This is a sample java mvc application created at my first company.
It has the regular CRUD operations and some Module relationships like one-to-many and self-relationship.

To deploy you'll need Apache Tomcat 7.0 server and import this project as a Maven Project in Eclipse that supports Java EE development.
Also need to edit the scripts and persistence.xml files based on the underlying database used.
